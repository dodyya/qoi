1. Implement the decoding (displaying) of ppm P3 and P6 images.     -- Only decided to do P6 because screw you. Check!
2. Make said decoding run automatically upon double clicking a .ppm -- Deferred to end of project
3. Implement the decoding of .qoi images.                           -- Yayyy!
4. Make said decoding run automatically upon double clicking a .qoi -- Hard. Deferred again.
5. Implement encoding from P6
6. Send someone a .qoi image                                        -- Done. Dad knew what it was.
7. If I feel up for it, repeat the above for .pngs instead of .qoi
8. Hook everything up to do png to qoi as a simple CLI tool


Decoding image:
file data -> chunk data -> chunks -> pixel vector created constructively
Data to chunks doesn't need lookahead, knows when to consume more
Chunks to pixels doesn't need lookahead, but yields more than one pixel at a time. Ergo not done with iterator.

Encoding image:
pixel vector -> chunks -> chunk data -> sandwich with header and footer
pixel vector to chunks probably isn't a pure iterator -- a run needs to greedily consume pixels, and it needs lookahead to know when to stop
Thus it should be a slice instead of an iterator.
Then, chunks to chunk data is pretty straightforward. Again, not a pure iterator since a chunk is a variable number of bytes.
